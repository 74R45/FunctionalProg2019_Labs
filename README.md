# Haskell labs for Functional Programming 2019

This is a collection of labs that helped me learn Haskell, which was my introduction to the Functional paradigm. I fell in love with the language so I kept trying to do these labs the best way I could.

With these labs I got 96/100 for Functional Programming 2019 course, so I decided to upload them here. Hope you enjoy :)
